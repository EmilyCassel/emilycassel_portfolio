                <p>I am currently in a full-stack Developer's course at Rutgers University. 
                        I have worked as the Executive Assistant to the family dairy goat farm, CU@ Lil Red Barn, for the last 10 years.
                        I obtained my under-graduate degree in exercise science from the University of Lynchurg.
                        I became a patient myself after dislocating my hip bouldering in Wyoming and spent a lot of time on the computer during recovery.
                        After recovery I worked on the family farm, taking some time off from school, to determine what I wanted to do.
                        I was torn between comptuer science which I had come to love, and the degree I already had.
                        I decided to make a career change and go into full-stack development.</p>
