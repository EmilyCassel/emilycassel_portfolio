## Description
This application is a portfolio for myself to show future employers. Though this is not a completed portfolio and is more a mock up.


## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development was to show future employers that I can do this kind of work and complete these projects. I want to showcase my work in a well done application that reflects me.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Technologies Used: 
This project uses the technologies of HTML and CSS


## Challenges 
Flex. Flex was a huge challenge for me. I had a really had time with flex but I played the frog game some and it helped. 


## Successes
Figuring out flex. Flex was such a challenge that figuring it out belongs in the successes


## Directions for Future Development
Put in my actual projects not fake ones. 
Also make it more user friendly maybe a drop down box to see projects 
Also add projects I have done myself that are not only ones done in school
